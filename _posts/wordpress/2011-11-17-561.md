启动tomcat时ERROR: transport error 202: bind failed: Address already in use
server.xml的端口已经改掉.不会产生冲突


在http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/857.page找到解决方法

    Thanks Orion! That was just the pointer I needed. It turns out that I had a weird bit of leftover configuration in my environment variables that was causing the -Xdebug settings to be mis-configured when they were included during startup. I removed the JAVA_OPTS value from my settings and everything works properly now. Many thanks.

发现在tomcat/bin/catalina.sh中有如下:

    CATALINA_OPTS="-server -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=12343"

将
address=12343 改为其他,问题解决...
