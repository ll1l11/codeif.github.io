title: mac下使用brew安装stunnel
---

使用如下命令安装:
    
    > brew install stunnel
    ==> Downloading ftp://ftp.stunnel.org/stunnel/archive/4.x/stunnel-4.56.tar.gz
    Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/stunnel-4.56.tar.gz
    ==> Patching
    patching file tools/stunnel.cnf
    ==> ./configure --disable-libwrap --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/stunnel/4.56 --sysc
    ==> make install
    ==> Caveats
    A bogus SSL server certificate has been installed to:
      /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem
    
    This certificate will be used by default unless a config file says otherwise!
    
    In your stunnel configuration, specify a SSL certificate with
    the "cert =" option for each service.
    Warning: Could not link stunnel. Unlinking...
    Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully
    The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local
    You can try again using `brew link stunnel'

    ==> Summary
    /usr/local/Cellar/stunnel/4.56: 37 files, 596K, built in 10 seconds 

根据提示执行下面的命令:

    > brew link stunnel
    Linking /usr/local/Cellar/stunnel/4.56... Warning: Could not link stunnel. Unlinking...
    
    Error: Could not symlink file: /usr/local/Cellar/stunnel/4.56/share/man/man8/stunnel.pl.8
    Target /usr/local/share/man/man8/stunnel.pl.8 already exists. You may need to delete it.
    To force the link and overwrite all other conflicting files, do:
      brew link --overwrite formula_name
    
    To list all files that would be deleted:
      brew link --overwrite --dry-run formula_name

继续执行下面的命令:

    > brew link --overwrite stunnel
    Linking /usr/local/Cellar/stunnel/4.56... Warning: Could not link stunnel. Unlinking...
    
    Error: Permission denied - /usr/local/share/doc/stunnel/TODO

提示权限错误,我们手动删除需要删除的文件

    brew link --overwrite --dry-run stunnel | xargs sudo rm

然后继续执行:
    
    > brew link stunnel
    Linking /usr/local/Cellar/stunnel/4.56... Warning: Could not link stunnel. Unlinking...
    
    Error: Could not symlink file: /usr/local/Cellar/stunnel/4.56/share/doc/stunnel/TODO
    /usr/local/share/doc/stunnel is not writable. You should change its permissions.

如果出现类似 is not writeable的错误, 执行:

    sudo chown -R mac的用户户名 路径

再次执行:
    
    > brew link stunnel
    Linking /usr/local/Cellar/stunnel/4.56... 23 symlinks created

修改配置文件:

    > vim /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

内容如下:

    pid = /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pid
    output = /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.log
    
    compression = zlib
    sslVersion = all
    
    options = NO_SSLv2
    options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS
    
    client = yes
    
    [openvpn]
    accept = 127.0.0.1:本机要代理的端口
    connect = vps的地址:squid配置的端口号

启动stunnel:

    sudo stunnel

关闭stunnel:

    > ps aux | grep stunnel | grep root | awk '{print $2}'| xargs sudo kill -9

或者:
    
    > cat /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pid | xargs sudo kill -9
